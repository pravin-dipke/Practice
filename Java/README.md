# Roadmap for Learning Java

This roadmap outlines the key areas to focus on when learning Java. It's designed to provide a structured path for understanding the fundamental concepts of Java programming.

## **Classes**
- **Declaring Members:**
  - **Fields:** Define the state of an object with variables.
  - **Methods:** Define the behavior of an object with functions.

## **Objects**
- **Class Instantiation:** Creating an instance of a class.
- **Reference Value:** The memory address of the object.
- **References:** Variables that hold the memory address of objects.
- **Instance Members:** Fields and methods belonging to an instance of a class.
- **Static Members:** Fields and methods belonging to the class itself, rather than an instance of the class.

## **Objects Vs Classes**
- Understanding the difference between objects (instances) and classes (blueprints).

## **Running a Java Program**
- **Compiling and Running:** The process of converting Java code into bytecode and executing it.
- **A Java Application:** An example of a simple Java application.
- **JVM, JRE:** Understanding the Java Virtual Machine and Java Runtime Environment.

## **Why Java is a Platform Independent?**
- Exploring the features that make Java platform independent.

## **What Makes Java Unique?**
- Discussing the characteristics that distinguish Java from other programming languages.

## **Bytecode**
- Understanding bytecode and its role in Java's platform independence and security.
